# My Journal

### Week 2
 - For 2-3 hours, I did the Command Line training.
 
 - I downloaded the **Visual Studio**.

 - I installed Git and opened a Github account.

 - I did the **Git** training. It took around 3-4 hours. I had trouble with configuration and did some Google search. It was'nt working because on the trainining instruction the configuration part has a typo (I think). There should be quotation marks when you write your e-mail. I figured that out after doing some research.
 - I was able to create a markdown file to creata a syllabus. But, I need to work and practice more in order to understand how to creata a repository and push it and commit it.



 ### Week 3 (02/09/20)

 - For an hour, I reviewed at the Command line training again.

 - In the 3rd hour, I started doing Git and Github training again and I created a new journal repository instead of opening my existig md file for my Journal. That caused a trouble when I pushed it because I had the same directory already. 

 - To understand the problem I made a search and read some Git trainings for 3 hours. 

 ## Week 4
- First hour, I downloaded the Python and did some practice like assigning variables and printing it.
 - For two hours I did the Introduction to Python training exercises in Data Camp website. It is about the first chapter about Python Basics, assigning variables and calculations with variables.

 - I did the chapter two Python training exercises about creating lists, subsetting, and extending lists.

 - Chapter three Python trainning exercises about some built in Functions and Packages of Python.
