# My Journal

### Week 2
 - For 2-3 hours, I did the Command Line training.
 
 - I downloaded the **Visual Studio**.

 - I installed Git and opened a Github account.

 - I did the **Git** training. It took around 3-4 hours. I had trouble with configuration and did some Google search. It was'nt working because on the trainining instruction the configuration part has a typo (I think). There should be quotation marks when you write your e-mail. I figured that out after doing some research.
 - I was able to create a markdown file to creata a syllabus. But, I need to work and practice more in order to understand how to creata a repository and push it and commit it.



 ### Week 3 (02/09/20)

 - I looked at the Command line training again.

 - I started doing Git and Github training again and I created a Markdown file for my Journal.
