# My Journal

### Week 1
 - For 2-3 hours, I did the Command Line training.
 
 - I downloaded the **Visual Studio**.

 - I installed Git and opened a Github account.

 - I did the **Git** training. It took around 3-4 hours. I had trouble with configuration and did some Google search. It was'nt working because on the trainining instruction the configuration part has a typo (I think). There should be quotation marks when you write your e-mail. I figured that out after doing some research.
 - I was able to create a markdown file to creata a syllabus. But, I need to work and practice more in order to understand how to creata a repository and push it and commit it.



 ### Week 2 (02/09/20)

 - For an hour, I reviewed at the Command line training again.

 - In the 3rd hour, I started doing Git and Github training again and I created a new journal repository instead of opening my existig md file for my Journal. That caused a trouble when I pushed it because I had the same directory already. 

 - To understand the problem I made a search and read some Git trainings for 3 hours. 

 

 ###  Week 3
- First hour, I downloaded the Anaconda and did some practice like assigning variables and printing it.
 - For an hour, I did exercises 0-6 from Learn Python the Hard Way.
 - For two hours I did the Introduction to Python training exercises in Data Camp website. It is about the first chapter about Python Basics, assigning variables and calculations with variables.

 - I did the chapter two Python training exercises about creating lists, subsetting, and extending lists.

 

### Week 4

- For two hours, I watched the videos and did exercises in chapter three that is about some built in Functions (e.g. print(), type(), int(), and str()) and Packages of Python such as "math".

- I wrote some code to practice the  control flow functions like `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

 ### Week 5

 - I installed the Jekyll. It took me couple of hours because I had to install a new software, MacOs Catalina to my laptop in order to install jekyll.

 - I created a new website for practice. I looked at the training websites HTML on W3schools and CSS on W3schools to get some help.

 



 ### week 6
 - There was a Python bootcamp on Saturday, March 28 from 11:00 am - 4:00 pm. The workshop was about Python library `Pandas`. We practiced importing data with pandas, filtering, manipulating values in DataFrame, plotting, and etc.

 - I had the problem running my python lyrics.py file because my laptop was running python 2.7. I reinstalled Anaconda. I still got an error that was saying that `module requests not found`. I made a lot of search and installed `pipenv` and finally I didn't get an error, but unfortunately, I still don't understand what my lyrics.py file does.

 ### Week 7
 - I watched some videos on Khan Academy about HTML and CSS.
 - I did some HTML tutorial exercises on  W3Schools.
 - I watched a  you tube video that is an hour and 30 minutes long to set up the Visual Studio Code. Sometimes I get a problem when I want to open VSC on the command line. It doesn't open the VSC. I hope the problem is fixed. 
 

 ## Week 8 
-  My VSC says that there are 15000 active changes that should be committed to github. I don't know the reason, but I made some search to fix that. In a website, a person says that I need to create a `git.ignore` file. I created to fix it. It looked like fixed, but later I saw the same thing again. I don't know how to fix it permanently. I need to do more research.

## Week 9
- My VSC says the `requests` library cannot be imported. I made a lot of search and tried many different ways, but still could not fix it.

- I did the SQL tutorials on W3schools.

## Week 10

- I did some search for my project. I looked up for some mathematical functions that can be created in Python. 

- I practiced defining functions in Python.

- My VSC says `flask` and `requests` cannot be imported. I searched for that and tried to fix it, but it didn't work

## Week 11
- DHRI Introduction to Databases tutorial

- SQL tutorial on ww3schools

- Worked on Python to define new functions

## Week 13

- Worked on my project 

## Week 14

- Adding on my project
- Creating a README Markdown file for my project.
